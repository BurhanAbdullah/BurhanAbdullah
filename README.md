### 🏛 Research Focus
My work explores the intersection of **Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS)** and **Artificial Intelligence**. I am specifically focused on creating high-assurance communication frameworks and agentic interfaces for large-scale power grid simulations.

### 🚀 Key Technical Contributions

#### [Power-Agent / PowerMCP](https://github.com/Power-Agent/PowerMCP)
*Developing the standard for LLM-to-Power-System interaction.*
* Implemented **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** servers for **PowerWorld** and **OpenDSS**.
* Enabling LLMs to execute power flow analysis and contingency analysis through natural language.

#### [Aegis-Grid](https://github.com/BurhanAbdullah/Aegis-Grid)
*High-assurance cryptographic communication for the grid.*
* Designed an agentic framework utilizing **Shannon Entropy Mirroring**.
* Focuses on adaptive $(n, k)$ thresholding to mitigate Cumulative Attack vectors.

#### [OceanBase / PowerRAG](https://github.com/oceanbase/powerrag)
*Industrial-grade Retrieval-Augmented Generation.*
* Optimizing multi-modal retrieval systems for complex engineering documentation and grid datasets.
